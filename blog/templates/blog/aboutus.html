    <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
    <div class="developer-box">
        <p>
            I'm <strong>MOHAMED AL AFSAL</strong>, the developer behind BlogSphere. Fueled by curiosity and creativity, I designed BlogSphere to be more than just a blog—it's a digital playground for minds that dare to share.
        </p>
        <p>
            BlogSphere is built using modern web technologies—HTML, CSS on the frontend for a sleek UI, and Python (Django) on the backend for performance and security. Data is powered by MySQL for fast and reliable access.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by dark neon aesthetics, this project is a fusion of my love for design, development, and digital storytelling. My mission? To help every voice shine bright in the NeonForge.
